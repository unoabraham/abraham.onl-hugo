title: About Abraham
---

Hi, I’m Rajiv Abraham and this is my indieblog built on the tenets of the IndieWeb. This blog is unique in that it’s going to be all about blogging technologies and the IndieWeb. In other words, I will be trying out various content management systems, web technologies, the IndieWeb, and also keeping myself up to date with the changes in the blogosphere, and documenting everything here.

The goal is simple, make it easy for people to get online by documenting everything.

I have some experience with blogging and content management systems, and at one time or another I have tried most of the major ones like WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, etc. as well as static website generators like Hugo and Jekyll.

The one thing I have going for me as I’m a geek, and I love to tinker. My approach to learning is DIY, and that’s how I have learned everything from basic HTML and CSS to running a Linux server at home, as well as various projects on the Raspberry Pi.

I have also been trying to get more people to own their content and online identities by creating and posting content under their own domain names instead of social media like Facebook and Twitter.

At [Abraham's Indieblog](https://abraham.onl/ "Abraham's Indieblog") I plan to document everything that is related to the IndieWeb and various content management systems, and hopefully, over time it will push more people towards owning their online identities at least from my circle of family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances.

And yeah that's me.
