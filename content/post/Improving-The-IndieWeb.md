Improving the IndieWeb
Here are my thoughts and observations on what can be done to make the IndieWeb even better.

Do you really own your data? One of the primary arguments in favor of the IndieWeb movement is owning your data. The typical reasons given are the silos (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) own your data once it’s uploaded on their platform. More importantly, they are free to do with it as they see fit, including using it for commercial purposes like advertising. Another argument is if the business closes shop, you will lose all of your data. Remember Orkut or MySpace?

While I agree on both these points, I would still like to state the obvious that having your own domain name does not guarantee that you own your data. Let me clarify that a bit. I take a lot of photographs with my digital camera, and even more so with my smartphone. All of them are uploaded to the likes of Google Photos, Flickr, etc. However, if these online services go out of business, and I have not backed up my photographs on a hard drive and/or in the cloud, then I don’t really own my data. The data is pretty much lost if the online services close shop, and my smartphone and digital camera eventually stop working.

Unless your content is backed up, and can be easily exported or moved to a new host or service provider, you don’t really own your data.

I have seen many folks using a blogging service with a custom domain and living in the mistaken belief that their data is safe. It is not. Your content is hosted on a platform that you don’t own, and can be removed without notice if you are in violation of any of their Terms of Service. This violation can be anything from hate speech to simply not agreeing with popular opinion, or even toeing the PC line. I have moved way too many times and also lost data in the process, so I like to be doubly sure that I really owe my data… and so should you.

The real goal should be that your content will outlive any platform, and will also outlive any domain name changes. I have changed so many hosts, I have simply lost count. I have also changed my domain name a bunch of times. But in every instance the content had remained and available on the Internet. That’s content ownership according to me.
