Why to Microblog?
Of course, Facebook and Twitter continue to be platforms for microblogging, and they also make it very easy for everybody because the barrier to entry is non-existent on them. However, people fail to realize that most of their content is gone and lost in a couple of days. Any content shared on these microblogging platforms ceases to exist once it disappears from the timeline. Try to recollect what you shared last Thursday? Or 3 months ago? Unlikely right?

However, I can tell you what my status update was last Thursday, 37 days ago, or even 9 years ago because it is self-hosted and does not disappear from the timeline. I can tell you exactly what day and time and with whom I saw The Dark Knight, but only because I made a note, posted photographs, and wrote a review on my blog. Most folks would have done the same, but instead would have posted on Twitter and/or Facebook, and they would be hard-pressed to dig up the relevant links, photographs, etc. In other words, these memories are lost, call it the social media timeline paradox if you will.

Self-hosted microbloggers and bloggers, however, can continue to share those memories, photographs, videos, etc. by simply sharing the link from their self-hosted microblog/blog.

So you see is not just about owning your content, but itâ€™s also about owning your memories.
