Regular readers of my blogs will know that I have been blogging from 2004 with self-hosted WordPress. However, that hasn’t meant that I have always known all things about blogging, much less all of the available blogging technologies, and if anything I have always considered myself a student who learns best by going the route of DIY. 

After a decade of blogging, sometime in 2014 I decided I wanted a break from just about everything including blogging! I just wanted to unplug and unwind from the world in general, and just wanted to take time out for myself, travel a bit, kick things back, spend a lot of time listening to music, become a couch potato and binge watch all of the movies and shows I’d be missing out on, etc. 

So I did exactly that. I got out of most of my businesses, and shut down all of my blogs, though I kept all of the backups and the domains. I simply unplugged from the Internet after having worked online for 15 to 18 hours every day for a few years. I stopped reading up on blogs, stop following the news, gave up on all the latest tech news, and even stop reading my email.

I took some time off, mostly spent in travel, eating, some whiskey, and lots of TV. I was watching over 80+ shows at one time. I did this for a good 4 years until like all good things even this had run its course, and I was itching to get back online. Of course, while the break did me lots of good, it also made me lose touch with everything. From running and managing over 80 blogs and websites, I had come full circle to the point I had even forgotten most of basic WordPress, HTML, and CSS stuff. Thankfully, it did not take me more than a couple of hours of watching YouTube videos to bring myself up to speed with all the latest in the world of WordPress. 

All of the reading up and catching up on all the latest also brought me up to speed on topics like the <a href="https://indieweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndieWeb</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microblogging</a>. I spent a good couple of days going through the IndieWeb website and reading up on everything. Most of it was new to even somebody like me who lived and breathed blogs and search engine optimization for over 6 years. 

Anyway to cut a long story short, one of the first websites built on the IndieWeb philosophy that I came across was by <a href="https://boffosocko.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Aldrich</a>. This was a living and breathing example of what an IndieWeb website should be, Chris had covered everything from basic blogging to Webmention, Backfeed, and various other IndieWeb technologies that let him actually post to and interact with people on other blogs and social media websites like Twitter from his own website. 

To make that clear (especially for folks who have no idea what the IndieWeb is), Chris was actually posting to Twitter by posting on his WordPress blog. He was also commenting on other blogs by posting the comments on his own blog. Of course, I’d already spent a couple of days going through the IndieWeb website, but this still blew my mind, especially given what could be accomplished in terms of interacting with other websites and people while still staying and posting on your own website. 

I knew right then the IndieWeb was for me, never mind how hard it was to set up, and never mind how long it took to configure things till they worked as advertised. 

But that brings me to the major decision I had to make and how that led me down a different IndieWeb path. Chris’ website is unique, probably one of a kind, though a couple more like <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aaron Parecki</a> and <a href="https://readwriterespond.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aaron Davis.</a> also come to mind. But the one thing about Chris’ website is that it is a behemoth, and consists of multiple moving parts as well as functioning as an all in one solution for everything that is the IndieWeb. It is a complex machine and very obviously will need complex coding and upkeep to continue functioning as a mothership and central repository to all that is Chris Aldrich and the IndieWeb. A cursory glance at the home page will reveal that it is everything from a blog, to a linkblog with social bookmarks, and has all manner of content from blog posts, notes, and replies, to podcasts, and microcasts, and even check-ins like Foursquare. 

Put simply, my blog would need to be a blog, a photoblog, a microblog, a bookmarking service, a podcasting service, have IndieWeb functionality like Webmention and Backfeed that would let me comment from my website and have the comments syndicated to other blogs and services like Twitter, have the ability to post check-ins, take notes, and probably also serve videos like YouTube. And all of this is just off the top of my head, I am sure Chris’ blog does a million other things that I have absolutely no idea about. 

I spent a couple of days mulling over this decision.  I could have a mothership which would act as a central repository for everything that I am and all of my online identities, and that would mean I would need to spend a lot of time on this single website, both to build it out as well as to keep it running. 

Or I could build out multiple websites, each devoted to a single function and serving a single purpose. In other words, I could have a separate domain and website for a blog, a microblog, a photoblog, a weblog, a tech blog, a personal blog, a political blog, etc. Also, I could use a different content management system for each of these intended websites and choose the best one applicable. For instance, I could go with a static website for my linkblog/bookmarks as they don’t really need to be social or have IndieWeb functionality inbuilt, or even have a commenting system in place. I could use Ghost as the CMS for my blog. I could use Known for my microblog as it comes with a lot of the IndieWeb inbuilt. I could host my photoblog on a professional service like Wix or get a CMS that was totally suited for photographs, albums, and galleries. 

I finally made the decision to go with separate websites, kind of like a satellite system that was individual and independent but at the same time interlinked. The main reasons were ease of use, easy to take backups and export, and easier, in the long run, to design and build out the kind of website you want to end up with. 

Now don’t get me wrong, this is also easily done on a single domain with the use of multiple subdomains, each subdomain having its own CMS and serving a different purpose and function, micro.domain.com will serve as a microblog, blog.domain.com as a blog, photos.domain.com as a photo gallery and so on. This is something I have experience with, using the multisite functionality with WordPress, as well as having multiple websites with subdomains. 

I chose to not go this route simply because of my past experience, knowing fully well that backing up and deploying these websites will take a lot more effort, and subdomains also require a lot more work in terms of setup, search engine optimization, etc. Added to the fact that the cost of domains these days is extremely affordable (unless you happen to have a premium name like Abraham, which I do), and hosting multiple websites is easily done on a VPS, I made the decision in favor of having separate domain names and building out separate websites. 

Of course, nothing is set in stone, and both plans and people always change, but my initial plan is to go with multiple domains and websites. My initial plan consisted of these websites each serving a different purpose and area of my life.

As I said, like all plans they are subject to change, and I still have ideas for other websites like a note-taking and read it later website, a website where I would scrobble all the music I listen to (just like Last.FM), a website that would list all of the movies and TV shows I watch with mini-reviews and linear notes, a recipe blog, a family tree blog, and a few more ideas that I have swirling around in my head. 

I have had most of these in the past, a personally hosted website that listed all of the music I listened to and also tweeted them out, as well as a personal movie blog that ran on a script that was very much like IMDb and even pulled in artwork as well as relevant data from IMDb, as well as a photoblog that made albums, galleries, and slideshows from the photographs I uploaded. 

This is the big picture, the 30,000-foot view of all of my plans, and something I wanted to put out for now. Obviously, it will have course correction and updates in the form of changes, additions, as well as deletions over time, and I will continue to update and post about them over here.
