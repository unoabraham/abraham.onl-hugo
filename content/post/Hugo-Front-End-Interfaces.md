Trying Out Hugo Front End Interfaces
Netlify CMS, is very easy to setup, in fact less than 5 minutes to set up, configure, and deploy.

DNS propagation might be the only thing that will delay you, especially when setting up HTTPS.

While I like the ease of use, the front-end interface is extremely limited, and comes with a limited set of pages that you can delete, but cannot add a new page, not even replace a deleted page.

Creating new posts though works, and that should suit folks considering this option for quick and easy blog posts.

However, there is no choice in terms of themes, no options to change the design or the interface, etc. All you get is a website deployed and a set theme and navigation menu that you can only make minute changes to from within the front-end interface.

For more customization you will need to access from a local Git via the command line interface.

Only useful and recommended when you want to make quick blog posts from the browser interface and do not have access to a PC or laptop with Git installed.
